    "# Modeling a Borrower's Credit Risk\n",
    "----\n",
    "The focus of this project is on credit modelling, a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk. \n",
    "Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. Data is about lending data from Lending Club. \n",
    "Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.\n",
    "The aim of the project is to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?\n"

    "Unfortunately, even through we're not using accuracy as an error metric, the classifier is, and it isn't accounting for the imbalance in the classes. There are a few ways to get a classifier to correct for imbalanced classes. The two main ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use oversampling and undersampling to ensure that the classifier gets input that has a balanced number of each class.\n",
    "    - They involve taking a sample that contains equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0, and where loan_status is 1. This way, the classifier is forced to make actual predictions, since predicting all 1s or all 0s will only result in 50% accuracy at most.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Tell the classifier to penalize misclassifications of the less prevalent class more than the other class.\n",
    "    - We can do this by setting the class_weight parameter to balanced when creating the LogisticRegression instance. This tells scikit-learn to penalize the misclassification of the minority class during the training process. The penalty means that the logistic regression classifier pays more attention to correctly classifying rows where loan_status is 0. This lowers accuracy when loan_status is 1, but raises accuracy when loan_status is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is actually much easier to implement using scikit-learn."
